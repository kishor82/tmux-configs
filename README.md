# Tmux Configuration

This repository contains my custom tmux configuration, including settings and plugins.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `~/.config/` directory:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kishor82/tmux-configs.git ~/.config/tmux
   ```

2. After adding or modifying the configuration, run the following command to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   tmux source ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf
   ```

3. Install plugins by pressing `<PrefixKey> + I` within tmux. (Note: The default `<PrefixKey>` is `Ctrl-b`)

## Customization

Feel free to customize the configuration to suit your preferences. The configuration file (`tmux.config`) is well-commented, making it easy to understand and modify.

Happy tmuxing!
